# Olive Entities
Almost every business application deals with business entities. 

An entity is some unit of data that can be classified and have stated relationships to other entities.
In terms of the database, an entity is a single person, place, or thing about which data can be stored.

Olive introduces some basic abstractions for business entities, in order to provide frequently needed functionality out of the box. These abstractions enable useful and often required functionality such as data storage, logging, sorting, replication, CSV conversions, etc.

## IEntity
The `IEntity` interface is the most basic abstraction.
