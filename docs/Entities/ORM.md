# Olive ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Olive entities are basic C# objects. You can therefore use them with any ORM technology, such as *Entity Framework*. Though, they won't invoke the lifecycle events, and you will need to be careful in how you write your business logic related to object lifecycle.

Olive provides an ORM framework that is specifically designed for easier use, higher flexibility and better performance than Entity Framework or almost any other ORM technology. For example, in executing queries, it's on average twice as performant as Entity Framework.
