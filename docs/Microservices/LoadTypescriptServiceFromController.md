# Loading a typescript service module from controller

Read [this article](../MvcJS/MigrationAndDI.md#loading-a-module-from-controller-or-viewcomponent) first.


In order to load a typescript service module from controller you need to make sure:
* You have the `Olive.Mvc` >= `v2.1.133` and `Olive.Mvc.Microservices` >= 
`v2.1.104` in your project.
* Your controllers in are drived from `Olive.Mvc.Microservices.Controller`
* You have configured the services currectly in your project.

```csharp
public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    //...
    services.AddTSConfiguration();
}
```
* You have created the configure services file in your project. To do so, you need 
to create a typescript file name `configureServices.ts` which would be like:

```typescript
//...
import OlivePage from "olive/olivePage.js";
import { ServiceDescription } from "olive/di/serviceDescription.js";

export default class ConfigureServices {
    public static configure(services: ServiceContainer) {
        services.addSingleton(MyServices.CustomModule, 
            (waiting: Waiting) => new CustomModule(waiting)
        )
        .withDependencies(Services.Waiting);
    }
}

ConfigureServices.configure((<OlivePage>window.page).services);
```
