# Use AWS S3 as the temp folder to upload files

If you need to use S3 to be the temp storage when you are uploading a file you need to follow the following steps. But if you need to store the files in the S3 permanently, read [this](/Entities/Blob.md). Also, you may use both if you are hosting your service as a lambda function.

First things first, create a bucket which should have the following settings.
- It should be open for public to upload to or download from it.
- It should not let public get the list of the files.
- It should not keep the files for a long time. Let say 1 hour.
- There should be a user (AccessKey and Secret) which is allowed to list the files in the the bucket.

Next, add the following settings to the `appsettings.json`.
```json
...
"Blob": {
    "S3": {
        "Region": "REGION",
        "TempBucket": "BUCKET_NAME",
    }
}
...
```
Then, in your `Startup.cs` call `AddS3FileRequestService` in `ConfigureServices` before calling the base method.
```csharp
public override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
    ...
    services.AddS3FileRequestService();

    base.ConfigureServices(services);
    ...
```
